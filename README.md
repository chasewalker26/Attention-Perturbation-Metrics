# Attention Perturbation Metrics (APMs)
The official implementation of "Rethinking Attribution Quality Metrics for Vision Transformers".

## How to Use APMs
See `APM/example.ipynb` for a full example of the application of the source code for our APMs compared with their IPM counterparts.

It shows:
<ul>
  <li>Importing and setting up models and images for prediction.</li>
  <li>Generating attributions. </li>
  <li>Evaluating attributions with APMs and IPMs.</li>
</ul>

## Replicating the Paper Experiments
To replicate the paper experiments, please see the README inside of the `APM/experiments` folder.

All experimental data reported in the paper was generated by these tests and the commands in the README.
